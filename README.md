# RSeqAn
SeqAn Headers for R

## About

This package provides R with access to [SeqAn v2.4](http://www.seqan.de/) header files. SeqAn is an open source C++ library of efficient algorithms and data structures for the analysis of sequences with the focus on biological data.

RSeqAn can be used via the `LinkingTo:` field in the `DESCRIPTION` field of an R package. Note that the compiler will need to compile as C++14. This can be done in R as `Sys.setenv("PKG_CXXFLAGS"="-std=c++14")`.
