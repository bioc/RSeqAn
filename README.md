## Overview

This package provides R with access to [SeqAn v2.4](http://www.seqan.de/) header files. SeqAn is an open source C++ library of efficient algorithms and data structures for the analysis of sequences with the focus on biological data.

## Usage

RSeqAn can be used via the `LinkingTo:` field in the `DESCRIPTION` field of an R package. Note that the compiler will need to compile as C++14. This can be done in R as `Sys.setenv("PKG_CXXFLAGS"="-std=c++14")`.

For a quick example, see our [introductory vignette](https://compbiocore.github.io/RSeqAn/first_example/). Alternatively you can run the C++ code from the vignette directly by entering

```r
Rcpp::sourceCpp(system.file("extdata","first_example.cpp",package="RSeqAn"))
pattern_search("This is an awesome tutorial to get to know SeqAn!", "tutorial")
```

Don't forget to set the C++14 compiler flags if you do this!

## Installation

 * We recommend installing the release version [through Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/RSeqAn.html), especially if you are running R on Windows. Instructions are provided on their page.

 * Version 1.3.1 can also be installed [through Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/RSeqAn.html) (for now, Bioconductor has a separate release cycle), downloaded as [a tagged release](https://github.com/compbiocore/RSeqAn/releases/tag/v1.3.1), or installed with `devtools` by running:
```r
devtools::install_github("compbiocore/RSeqAn", ref="v1.3.1")
```
This version contains `Rcpp::as` and `Rcpp::wrap` functions for `CharString` and is the one submitted to the [Journal of Open Source Software](https://joss.theoj.org/).

 * The development version can be installed with `devtools` by running:
```r
devtools::install_github("compbiocore/RSeqAn", ref="devel")
```
This version contains additional wrappers, though we cannot guarantee that they will work for you.
